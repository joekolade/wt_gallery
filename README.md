# wt_gallery

Patched version of Pibase TYPO3 Extension **wt_gallery 3.7.1** for use with FAL and TYPO3 Cms 6.2

For free use.

**Use at own risk.**

## Problem

Main problem was the use of FAL in plugin configuration flexforms.

Adding a switch to both "controller" files (*list* and *single*) lets you use both old configured migrated plugins and new initialized ones.

## This work is a quick fix!

**Use at own risk.**

You will have to patch **wt_doorman** as well (see: [https://github.com/chriwo/wt_doorman](https://github.com/chriwo/wt_doorman))
